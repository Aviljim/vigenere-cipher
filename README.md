# VigenÃ¨re Cipher â€“ String Manipulation Practice

This project is a simple encryption and decryption tool using the VigenÃ¨re cipher, built in Python. I used it to mess around with string manipulation and understand how basic ciphers work - nothing fancy, just clean logic and custom shifting based on a key.

## What it does (in simple terms)

- You give it a message (`text`)
- You give it a key (`custom_key`)
- It uses that key to shift each letter of your message in a special way
- You can also decrypt it back by reversing the same process

This is all done using basic math and string handling - no libraries or anything, just raw Python logic.

What I practiced
Basic function building in Python

Using loops and indexing

Custom encryption logic

Modulo math and character manipulation
